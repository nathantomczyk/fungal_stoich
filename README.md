Abstract

Saprotrophic fungi play an important role in transformations involving carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) in aquatic environments. However, it is unclear how climate warming will alter the role of fungi in the coupled cycling of C, N, and P. We conducted a microcosm experiment with pure cultures of four aquatic hyphomycetes (Articulospora tetracladia, Hydrocina chaetocladia, Flagellospora sp., and Aquanectria penicillioides), as well as a mixed assemblage of the same four taxa, to test how temperature influenced key parameters related to carbon and nutrient use. Specifically, we evaluated the effects of temperature on biomass accrual, nutrient use efficiency (NUE, as tissue C:N, C:P), δ13C, and carbon use efficiency (CUE) over a 35-d experiment in which incubation temperatures ranged from 4ºC to 20ºC. While each taxon responded differently to temperature, changes in biomass accrual and CUE were predominantly unimodal with peaks between 7ºC and 15ºC. The C:P of H. chaetocladia biomass increased 9× over the temperature gradient, though the C:P of other taxa was unaffected by temperature. Changes in C:N were relatively small across taxa. The δ13C of some taxa changed across temperatures, indicating potential shifts in physiology. Additionally, we found that the 4-species assemblage differed from null expectations based on the performance of the monocultures in terms of biomass accrual, C:P, δ13C, and CUE, which suggests that interactions among taxa altered carbon and nutrient use. Together these results highlight that temperature and interspecific interactions among fungi can alter traits that affect carbon flow and nutrient cycling.
